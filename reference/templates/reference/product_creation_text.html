        requiering cardboard will be effected. If in doubt contact

    </li>
    <li>
        Must <b>not</b> start with the title of the product. Doing so only

        <b>postage</b>.

</ul>

<h3 id="single_product_options">Product options</h3>
<h4>Other product information used for listings.</h4>
<p>
    Product options work differently for single items and variation
    products. This information is for single items. For variations
    please refer to <a href="#variation_product_options" target="_blank">variation product options</a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fill in any fields you feel apply to the product.</li>
    <li>Any fields that do not seem applicable or relevent should be left blank.</li>
    <li>Colour should be filled in for all products as this is required by Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variation_listings">Listing Variations</h2>
<p>
    While a single form is required to create a single item, creating a product
    with variations is a two step process. The first step is
    the <a href="#variation_product_form">new variation product form</a>,
    which is very similar to the new single product variation form. This is
    followed by the <a href="#variation_table">variation table</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="variation_product_form">New Variation Product Form</h3>
<p>
    The variation product form is very similar to the single product form.
    The <b>Barcode</b> field does not appear here. You will be able to add
    barcodes later. All the above information about fields still applies and
    can still be used as a checklist. You will notice that when listing
    variation products that checkboxes appear to the right of some fields.
    If there are any fields for which the required information is not the same
    for <b>every</b> variation the box next to it should be checked. If the
    field is optional it can be left blank, however anything you do enter will
    be provided as a default for all variations. If the information in this
    field will be the same for most of your variations you can enter it here
    to save typing later. If the field is not optional something must be
    entered. This can be the correct information for one or some of your
    variations or a placeholder. For <b>Price</b>, <b>Purchase Price</b> and
    <b>Weight</b> zero is a viable placeholder but another value must be
    entered for all variations on the next page.
</p>
<p>
    When the form is complete you will be presented with a table containing
    each field you have selected for each existant variation. These fields
    should be filled in in exactly the same way they otherwise would be.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Barcode</b> field will always appear here. As usual the manufactuer
    barcode can be used if available, otherwise it can be left blank to use
    new barcodes from our stock.
</p>

<h3 id="variation_product_options">Variation Product Options</h3>
<p>
    At the bottom of the new variation product form you will see the same list
    of <b>Product Options</b> as on the new single product form. Instead of a
    text box you will see the options <b>Unused</b>, <b>Single</b>,
    <b>Variable</b> and <b>Variation</b>.
</p>
<p>If the field is not applicable to the product leave <b>Unused</b> selected.</p>
<p>
    <b>Variation</b> should be selected for the options that most closely
    relates the the way in which the variation product varies. For instance
    shoes might use <b>Colour</b> and <b>Size</b>. This will be the name next to
    the drop down box(es) in listings. All existant values for each selected
    option must be listed in the boxes provided. This will be used to create
    the variation table on the next page. The <b>TAB</b> key can be used after
    typing a variation to enter the next box.
</p>
<p>
    Relevent product options can be used in the same way they are used for
    single items, to add information to the listing, if they are not variation
    options.
</p>
<p>
    If the information is the same for every variation select <b>Single</b>.
    The typed value will be applied to every variation.
</p>
<p>
    If the information is <b>not</b> the same for every variation
    select <b>Variable</b>. This will add this field to the table on the next page.
    As with other fields a default value can be added here.
</p>
<p>To clarify the above here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For a red T-Shirt that comes in a range of sizes you would select <b>Variarble</b>
        for the <b>Size</b> option and list the sizes. Then select <b>Single</b> for
        the <b>Colour</b> option and type &quot;Red&quot;.
        This would allow the customer to select their size and see that all the
        sizes come in one colour.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a product that comes in a range of sizes and colours you would
        select <b>Vatiation</b> for both <b>Size</b> and <b>Colour</b> and
        list the appropriate options in the applicable fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        For a named door plaque for which each name has a particular colourred
        background you would select <b>Variation</b> for <b>Name</b> and list
        the names, then select <b>Variable</b> for <b>Colour</b>. This would
        allow you to put the appropriate colour next to each name in the
        variation table on the next page.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variation_table">The Variation Table</h3>
<p>
    When the new variation product form is complete you will see the <b>variation table</b>.
    This will list every possible variation for your product by combining all
    the values from <b>Product Option</b> fields marked as <b>Variation</b>.
    For each variation you will have a <b>Barcode</b> field as well as any
    other field for which you checked the variable check box and any <b>Product Option</b>
    that was marked as <b>Variable</b>.
</p>
<p>
    You will also have a <b>Delete</b> checkbox.
    This should be checked for any variation that does not exist or that we will
    not be stocking. If there are any variations that we do not stock but are
    likely to in the future do not delete them. It is far easier to create them
    now and leave them out of stock than to add them later.
</p>
<p>
    All the fields in the <b>Variation Table</b> should be filled out in the
    same way they would in the new single product form or the new variation
    product form.
</p>

<h2 id="incomplete_products">Incomplete Products</h2>
<p>
    When the <b>Variation Table</b> has been submitted your new Product Range
    will be created and you will be taken to it's page in the inventory.
    However it will likey not yet be complete as variations are created in
    the background. This will happen even for single products. If you refresh
    the page you will see variations appearing. When all the variations have appeared
    and the page no longer says <b>INCOMPLETE</b> your product will have been
    successfully created. It is possible an error, in this case the product will
    remain <b>INCOMPLETE</b>. Please allow some time for it to complete before
    acting on this. Products with more variations will take longer to create
    and Cloud Commerce does not always operate at it's full capacity. If you are
    sure that an error has occured the product must be deleted and recreated.
</p>
