            </li>
            <li>
                Must <b>not</b> start with the title of the product. Doing so only
                makes sense on eBay as the description appears under the title

            </li>

            <li>Sentences must end with full stops.</li>
            <li>Size charts can should created using tables.</li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h3 id="single_product_options">Product options</h3>
        <h4>Other product information used for listings.</h4>
        <p>
            Product options work differently for single items and variation
            products. This information is for single items. For variations
            please refer to <a href="#variation_product_options" target="_blank">variation product options</a>.
        </p>
        <ul class="field_notes">
            <li>Fill in any fields you feel apply to the product.</li>
            <li>Any fields that do not seem applicable or relevent should be left blank.</li>
            <li>Colour should be filled in for all products as this is required by Amazon.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variation_listings">Listing Variations</h2>
<p>
    While a single form is required to create a single item, creating a product
    with variations is a two step process.
</p>
<p>
    The variation product form is very similar to the single product form.
    The <b>Barcode</b> field does not appear here. You will be able to add barcodes later.
    All the above information about fields still applies and can still be used as a checklist.
    You will notice that when listing variation products that checkboxes appear to the right of some fields.
    If there are any fields for which the required information is not the same for <b>every</b> variation
    the box next to it should be checked. If the field is optional it can be left blank,
    however anything you do enter will be provided as a default for all variations.
    If the information in this field will be the same for most of your variations
    you can enter it here to save typing later.
    If the field is not optional something must be entered. This can be the correct
    information for one or some of your variations or a placeholder.
    For <b>Price</b>, <b>Purchase Price</b> and <b>Weight</b> zero is a viable placeholder
    but another value must be entered for all variations on the next page.
</p>
<p>
    When the form is complete you will be presented with a table containing
    each field you have selected for each existant variation. These fields
    should be filled in in exactly the same way they otherwise would be.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Barcode</b> field will always appear here. As usual the manufactuer
    barcode can be used if available, otherwise it can be left blank to use
    new barcodes from our stock.
</p>
<h3 id="variation_product_options">Variation Product Options</h3>
<h2>Incomplete Products</h2>
<p>
    At the bottom of the new variation product form you will see the same list
    of <b>Product Options</b> as on the new single product form. Instead of a
    text box you will see the options &quot;Unused&quot;, &quot;Single&quot;,
    &quot;Variable&quot; and &quot;Variation&quot;.
</p>
